====================
Search and Retrieval
====================

This page details instructions to search and retrieve data shared to the ENA Data Hubs. This builds on the ENAâ€™s General Guide on `ENA Data Retrieval <https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/general-guide.html>`_. Searching data involves creating queries to view matching data records. This is separate to retrieval which includes methods to download data records. Both have been described below.

.. note::
    ðŸ’¡  Search and retrieval is carried out using **Data Hub credentials, e.g. dcc_XXXX**.

--------------
Searching Data
--------------
The ENA Data Hubs enable users to search data:
* Interactively through Advanced Search in the ENA Data Hubs Portal.
* Programmatically through the ENA Portal API.

Both methods enable users to search across public and their own private (pre-release) data, either separately or in combination. In order to later download data, ensure that search results include fields related to file download links (e.g. â€˜submitted_ftpâ€™ or â€˜fastq_ftpâ€™).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Interactive Advanced Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advanced Search can be found here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/datahubs/search. If you would like to view any pre-release data, ensure that you have logged in with Data Hub credentials - e.g. dcc_XXXX.

You must specify a â€˜Data Typeâ€™ prior to structuring the query. For more information on Advanced Search, including how to structure your queries, see detailed documentation here: https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/retrieval/advanced-search.html.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Programmatic ENA Portal API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is a `Swagger interface <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/swagger-ui/index.html>`_ detailing all of the available endpoints and their options, but most users will use the /search endpoint. For complete documentation on the Portal API, see `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CwoY84MuZ3SdKYocqssumghBF88PWxUZ/edit?tab=t.0>`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Query Construction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many different types of data and fields can be queried using the Portal API. To help to construct your query, you can use `Advanced Search <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/datahubs/search>`_. From here, you can select different data types, construct data filters, set result limits and select custom field sets. Once you have made your selections, click on the â€˜Copy Curl Requestâ€™ button at the bottom right of the screen. This will provide users with a command without authentication, which you can modify to add Data Hub settings and authentication.

Paste your `curl` command into an editor. We will need to add some extra fields to the query to ensure it fetches data from your Data Hub:
1. Append the following to the `-d` section of your command:
.. code-block::
    &dataPortal=ena&dccDataOnly=true&limit=0
2. At the end of the command, add authentication using the `-u` flag:
.. code-block::
    -u 'dcc_user:dcc_password'

.. note::
    ðŸ’¡  Use limit=0 to return all results

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Search Data Hub Records Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To view only Data Hub records, ensure that you specify to view Data Hub records only. In Advanced Search, this is specified through the toggle under section 5 - â€˜Data Filtersâ€™, as shown in fig.1. Alternatively through ENA Portal API, specify `dccDataOnly=true` in your query, an example to fetch all raw read data held in a Data Hub has been included below.

**Figure 1**. Section 5 (â€˜Data Filtersâ€™) in Advanced Search in the Data Hubs Portal. This presents a toggle regarding whether a user would like to see only Data Hub records, or view Data Hub records alongside any public ENA records that match the overall query.

.. code-block::
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
        -d 'result=read_run&fields=run_accession%2Cstudy_accession%2Cfastq_ftp&dataPortal=ena&dccDataOnly=true&limit=0' \
        "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search" \
        -u 'dcc_user:dcc_password'

---------------
Retrieving Data
---------------
To retrieve data, users must do so programmatically. File download links from search results (see Searching Data above) enable you to choose from a few methods in order to fetch the data files using the links. These include (but are not limited to):
1. `wget` example:
.. code-block::
    wget --ftp-user=dcc_name --ftp-password=dcc_password \
    ftp://ftp.dcc-private.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/â€¦
2. `curl` example:
.. code-block::
    curl -u 'dcc_user:dcc_password' -O \
    "ftp://ftp.dcc-private.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/..."
