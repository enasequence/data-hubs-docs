Data Hub Dashboard
===================

The Data Hub Dashboard displays summary statistics and plots of data held across all public and private projects linked to a Data Hub of interest listed in the `Explore page <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/datahubs/active-datahubs>`_ . This includes aggregate data statistics relating to data type, sequencing platform, as well as plots showing, e.g. an overview of sample taxonomy distribution or data submission frequency. This can all be found under the ‘Summary’ tab of the dashboard (Figure 1).
