Registering for a Data Hub
==========================

To obtain a Data Hub, a user must register interest, via the form on the `Data Hubs Portal <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/datahubs/request-datahub#request-data-hub>`_ . This is to be completed by a coordinator of the Data Hub.

For a request, the coordinator must have a valid Webin account (e.g. Webin-XXXXX). To register for a Webin account, see here: <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/login>. Coordinators must also provide their name, email address (preferably institutional), affiliation, and information about the prospective Data Hub. This includes an estimate for the number of users, how long it is required for, and the overall reason for request.

Once a coordinator submits the request, the ENA’s support team is notified and will assess the request, prior to assigning the Data Hub (if approved), within 2 working days.

The registration form enables the ENA to better understand the requirement for a Data Hub. This will be used by the ENA’s support team to approve a request. Aspects that are taken into consideration include:

* The length of time that the Data Hub would be required for.
* The number of data providers and consumers there will be for the Data Hub.
* The number of institutes and their geographic spread.
* The volume of data to be shared and their frequency/regularity.
