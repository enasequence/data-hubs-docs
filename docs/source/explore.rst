The Explore Page
===================

The `Explore page <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/datahubs/active-datahubs>`_ allows you to view a list of all active Data Hubs -i.e those that have had data submitted to them within the past six months - that exist in ENA. 
The page presents brief information for each Data Hub, registered by different co-ordinators, and you can search amongst these by Data Hub name (Figure 1). 
Logging in with credentials is not required, and the page is accessible to all users.
