Data Hub Management
===================

This page provides specific guidance to coordinators of Data Hubs. As the coordinator of an ENA Data Hub, you have control over many settings, which can be managed through the `ENA Data Hubs Portal <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/datahubs/>`_.

After logging into the Data Hubs Portal, navigate to the ‘Manage’ tab (or click on the ‘My Data Hubs’ card). Here you will be presented with a list of Data Hubs that you are associated with.

Where you have coordinator permissions on a Data Hub, you will see an edit icon in the ‘Action’ column (figure 1).

From these menus, you can begin to manage your Data Hub settings:

* **General**: view Data Hub names/topic, add display name, or update description
* **Users**: view and add users, and update their roles
